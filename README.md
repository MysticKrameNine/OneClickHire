# OneClickHire

Minimal job-aggregator in **TypeScript**.  
Pulls openings from reliable sources and returns a **unified JSON**.

**Sources (MVP)**
- Adzuna API (broad coverage)
- Jooble API (global coverage)
- Greenhouse Job Boards (per-company)
- Remotive (public API â€” temporarily tolerant to outages)

The pipeline is **resilient** (one source can fail and the app still returns results).
